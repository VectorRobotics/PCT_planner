  ros__parameters:
    # Operating Mode
    # mode: Operation mode for the planner
    #   'slam': Real-time tomogram building from point cloud map (subscribes to /explored_areas)
    #   'relocalization': Uses pre-loaded tomogram pickle file (no map subscription)
    mode: 'relocalization'

    # tomogram_path: Absolute path to tomogram pickle file (required for relocalization mode)
    # Only used when mode is 'relocalization', ignored in 'slam' mode
    # Example: '/path/to/map_tomogram.pickle'
    tomogram_path: '/home/alex-lin/autonomy_stack_mecanum_wheel_platform/src/route_planner/PCT_planner/pct_planner/rsc/tomogram/map.pickle'

    # Map Resolution Parameters
    # resolution: Horizontal grid cell size (meters)
    # Lower values = higher detail but more computation
    # MATCHES tomography.py default
    resolution: 0.075

    # slice_dh: Vertical slice thickness (meters)
    # Height between each layer of the tomogram
    slice_dh: 0.4

    # ground_h: Ground height reference level (meters)
    # Set to 0.0 to auto-detect from point cloud
    ground_h: 0.0

    # Traversability Analysis Parameters
    # kernel_size: Neighborhood size for traversability assessment (grid cells)
    # Larger values = smoother terrain assessment but may miss small obstacles
    # Must be odd number (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.)
    # MATCHES tomography.py default
    kernel_size: 9

    # interval_min: Minimum vertical clearance (meters)
    # Minimum free space required above terrain for traversability
    # Higher values = require more overhead clearance
    interval_min: 0.3

    # interval_free: Free space interval threshold (meters)
    # Vertical space considered free for robot traversal
    # Should be greater than interval_min
    interval_free: 0.5

    # slope_max_deg: Maximum passable slope (degrees)
    # Increase to allow steeper terrain, decrease for more conservative planning
    # Default 30 deg ≈ 58% grade
    # Recommended: 20-35 degrees for most robots
    # MATCHES tomography.py default (0.36 radians = 20.63 degrees)
    slope_max: 0.36

    # step_max: Maximum step height (meters)
    # Maximum vertical discontinuity the robot can traverse
    # Should match robot's physical step-climbing capability
    # MATCHES tomography.py default
    step_max: 0.3

    # standable_ratio: Proportion of standable cells required in kernel (0.0-1.0)
    # Higher values = more conservative, requires more stable terrain
    # Lower values = allows planning in rougher terrain
    standable_ratio: 0.05

    # cost_barrier: Cost assigned to impassable/highly dangerous terrain
    # Areas with cost >= this value are considered impassable
    # Higher values = allow planning through riskier terrain
    # Default: 50.0 (conservative)
    cost_barrier: 80.0

    # Safety and Inflation Parameters
    # safe_margin: Robot safety buffer (meters)
    # Minimum clearance around obstacles
    # Should be larger than robot's physical radius
    # MATCHES tomography.py default
    safe_margin: 0.05

    # inflation: Additional inflation beyond safety margin (meters)
    # Creates a gradual cost gradient around obstacles
    # Total clearance = safe_margin + inflation
    # MATCHES tomography.py default
    inflation: 0.05

    # Waypoint Following Parameters (Adaptive Lookahead)
    # lookahead_distance: Maximum look-ahead distance for waypoint extraction (meters)
    # Distance ahead on the path where the next waypoint is selected on straight paths
    # Larger values = smoother following but less responsive to path changes
    # Smaller values = more accurate following but may be jerky
    # Recommended: 1.5-3.0 meters depending on robot speed
    lookahead_distance: 4.0

    # min_lookahead_distance: Minimum look-ahead distance on tight curves (meters)
    # The lookahead distance will scale down to this value on highly curved paths
    # Should be >= robot wheelbase for kinematic feasibility
    # Recommended: 0.3-0.8 meters
    min_lookahead_distance: 0.5

    # curvature_adaptive: Enable adaptive lookahead based on path curvature
    # true = reduce lookahead on curves for tighter tracking (recommended)
    # false = use constant lookahead_distance
    curvature_adaptive: true

    # curvature_scale: Sensitivity to path curvature (dimensionless)
    # Higher values = more aggressive lookahead reduction on curves
    # Lower values = gentler lookahead adjustment
    # Typical range: 0.5-2.0, recommended: 1.0
    curvature_scale: 1.5
